# Plotly-Challenge - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Demographics 
## Step 1: Plotly

The following plots are included in the dashboard using the Plotly.js framework:

1. Used  D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* Used `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

* Used `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

* Used `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

* Used `otu_ids` for the x values.

* Used `sample_values` for the y values.

* Used `sample_values` for the marker size.

* Used `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

* Used `otu_labels` for the text values.

* Created  a Gauge Chart  to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual for the gauge values ranging from 0 to 9. 

* Updates the chart whenever a new sample is selected.

4. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object on the page.

6. Updates all of the plots every time a new sample is selected.

Additionally, created layout that you would like for your dashboard.

## Deployment

* The dashboard can be viewed here: ![Belly Button Diversity Dashboard](/Images/Dashboard.png) 



## Hints

* Use `console.log` inside of your JavaScript code to see what your data looks like at each step.

* Refer to the [Plotly.js documentation](https://plot.ly/javascript/) when building the plots.
